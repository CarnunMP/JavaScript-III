/* The four principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding: 'this' in global scope (or top-level function) refers to the window object.
* 2. Implicit Binding: 'this' in an object refers to the object.
* 3. New Binding: 'this' in an object constructor refers to the prototype. (?)
* 4. Explicit Binding: 'this' is explicitly assigned by call(), apply() [both invocations], or bind().
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
